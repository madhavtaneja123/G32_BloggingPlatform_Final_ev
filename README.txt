Firstly Start the Flask Server (Backend API):
   - Navigate to the Flask project directory.
   - Run the following command:
     python app.py

Start the Django Server (Frontend):
   - Navigate to the Django project directory.
   - Run the following command:
     python manage.py runserver

Please make sure both servers are running simultaneously.
The Django frontend communicates with the Flask backend via RESTful APIs.
